# `cron.workshop.co`

Hi, there! Welcome to the docs for me, `cron.workshop.co`. I'm a little guy that schedules tasks and creates digest reports for you from Work-Shop's Paymo instance. My main use cases are to create recurring tasks in Paymo for specific users, to create recurring tasks for groups of users, and to compile digest reports of weekly activity to shoot over to you via email. In the future, I'd very much like to be able to respond to events that happen on Paymo and execute arbitrary HTTP tasks â€“ but I can't do that yet.
